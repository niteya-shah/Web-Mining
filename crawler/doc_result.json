First, I'd like to say that this article has plenty of excellent passages, and that researching and bringing a topic of this breadth to FAC is a very ", "impressive feat", ". I believe it could become a featured article. There are a number of spots where I found that the writing was of less than professional quality, re FAC criterion 1a. I am going to jumble various examples into one paragraph...\n"], ["Sidebar:", " The writing consistently fails to use \"that\" as a conjunction/", "complementizer", ", meaning [+that] phrases such as \"This has revealed [+that] the Gospels are both products\" are very confusing, as \"the Gospels\" can be initially read as the object of \"revealed\", when it isn't. In simpler cases this English dilemma seems to be a matter of taste, or dialect, or formality, or something\u00a0:-D \u2013 but in formal writing I do find it very awkward, to the point of objective complaint, in cases like \"Parry and Lord in 1978 demonstrated [+that] oral tradition does not develop...\". The more complex the construction, and the more commonly the verb might taken an object, the more of a problem it is. The same happens in this article with the verbs \"said\", \"argued\", \"asserted\", \"agree[d]\", \"believed\", \"demonstrated\". (As an aside, the repeated use of \"said\" is kind of informal if what the person did was \"write\", IMO.) It also happens in a slightly different form, e.g. \"such as those indicating [+that] Hebrew is older than previously believed\". The article itself proves my point when it writes \"theologian Schmidt observed ", "that", " Mark's Gospel is composed of short units\" rather than \"theologian Schmidt observed Mark's Gospel is composed of short units\", and \"scholar Paul R. House says ", "that", " the discipline of linguistics...\"\u2014a-ha!\n"], ["I don't know if I am allowed to criticize citation style (I think I'm not allowed), but a footnote like \"[86]:42\u201372[87]:13[88][89]:1-15[90]:278[81]:242,247\" inline after text makes reading harder. \n"], ["Thank you for taking these comments in good... faith.
